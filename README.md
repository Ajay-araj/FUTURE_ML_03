# Resume / Candidate Screening System
#### Introduction

This project implements an NLP-based Resume Screening System that automates the process of analyzing and ranking resumes based on a given job description. The system extracts relevant skills, calculates similarity scores, ranks candidates by job relevance, and identifies missing skills to assist recruiters in making data-driven hiring decisions.

####  Objective<br>
The objective of this project is to:<br>
Automate resume screening<br>
Compare resumes with job descriptions<br>
Rank candidates based on relevance<br>
Identify missing or required skills<br>
Reduce manual recruitment effort<br>

#### NLP & ML Techniques Used<br>
Text Preprocessing (Cleaning, Stopword Removal)<br>
Tokenization<br>
TF-IDF Vectorization<br>
Cosine Similarity<br>
Keyword-based Skill Extraction<br>
Candidate Ranking based on similarity score<br>

#### How the System Works<br>
Resume text is cleaned and preprocessed.<br>
A job description is defined.<br>
TF-IDF converts text into numerical vectors.<br>
Cosine similarity calculates match scores.<br>
Candidates are ranked from highest to lowest relevance.<br>
Missing skills are identified for each candidate.<br>

#### Results<br>
The system successfully:<br>
Ranked candidates based on job relevance.<br>
Identified key skills present in each resume.<br>
Highlighted missing required skills.<br>
Provided explainable match scores for recruiters.<br>

#### Business Impact
This system helps:<br>
Speed up resume screening<br>
Improve hiring consistency<br>
Reduce recruiter workload<br>
Support data-driven hiring decisions<br>

#### Technologies Used<br>
Python<br>
Pandas<br>
NumPy<br>
NLTK<br>
Scikit-learn<br>
Matplotlib<br>

#### Conclusion<br>
This project demonstrates how Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning techniques can be applied to solve real-world recruitment challenges. By automating resume evaluation and ranking, the system enhances efficiency and improves the overall hiring process.
